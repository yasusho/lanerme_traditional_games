日行	Day
遊人於日行々為下之労件。	On each Day, players perform the following actions in order.
無亦一時 斥値而手其時開之友連再閉。（心古行新）	[none/once] You return points and reconceal the set that you have previously revealed at that time. (“Dissolving a Department”)
無亦一時 開手片之一友連而手値。（与労）	[none/once] You reveal some pieces in your hand that can form a set, and obtain some score. (“Forming a Department”)
一時 始手片斥一片而行衣上之片而手片。（引人）	[once] [⌛] (“Hiring”)
汝須識々須為「引人」。	Note that Hiring is mandatory.
引人（須為）	Hiring (mandatory)
始手片斥一片而行衣上之片而手片。	You discard a piece, move another piece on the board, and obtain a piece.
手斥片付衣上静囲。	You start by discarding one of the pieces in your hand onto the empty square on the board.
能行之片生斥片之同色而大一位亦小一位之片。	The piece that you can move must be of the same color as the discarded piece, and its number must be one greater or one less.
汝須無生来斥片而片無能行之時。	It is forbidden to discard a piece that has no corresponding piece on the board, as it would be impossible to move any piece in such a situation.
片能行於周己之八囲。	A piece can move to one of the eight squares that surround it.
行入之処之片普時手此。	Usually, the piece you obtain is the one that was occupying the destination of your movement.
始山行術	When moving from the Mountain
皇山此皇色之囲。在山之片享皇之神力而能行於多多囲。	“Tam’s Mountain” is the green square. The piece on the mountain receives Tam’s mystical power and can go to a larger number of squares.
行術如絵。如皇字。	The move is as shown in the diagram below, resembling the Lanermic character for “Tam” (皇).
在道之片汝能無目。	You can ignore the intervening piece.
入水之時	When entering the water
皇水此水色之囲。入於水此極硬。	“Tam’s Water” is the blue square. It is very difficult to enter the water.
汝行片而心手皇水之片之時汝須撃裁。	When you move the piece and try to obtain a piece in the water square, you need to throw the dice-sticks.
裁無亦一亦二即汝手汝行之片。	When it is zero, one or two, you obtain the piece that you were moving.
三亦四亦五即汝手行処皇水之片。	When three, four or five, you obtain the piece that is in the water square that you are moving to.
歪片裁術	Jokers
汝使歪片能為別片之労。	You can use a joker to serve as the role of another piece.
此故始手片斥歪片之時汝能行衣上之或色或位之片。	Thus, when you discard a joker, you can move an arbitrary piece on the board.
逆道衣上歪片此斥或色或位而能行此。	Oppositely, when there is a joker on the board, you can discard a piece of any color and number in order to be qualified to move the joker.
与労（全多一時）（無為此善）	Forming a Department (optional)
於手片三片之友連在即能為此労。	When three pieces in your hand can form a three-of-a-kind or a sequence-of-three, you can perform this action.
開其友連而手加値。	You reveal the set and earn the bonus score.
開片此手片別而無能斥。為心古行新之労即唯再斥。	The revealed pieces remain in your hand, but they cannot be discarded. The only way to discard them is to dissolve the department.
三友	Three-of-a-kind
同色同値三片	Three pieces with the same color and the same number
三連	Sequence-of-three
同色連値三片	Three pieces with the same color and the consecutive numbers
端値無連	The numbers do not wrap around.
加値	Bonus score
目友連全大之片而手加値。	Find the piece with the largest number on it and earn the bonus score based on that number.
目棚絵定加値。	Look at the table below and determine the bonus score.
使歪片於全大之片之時手無真之値之加値。	When a joker is used to represent the largest number in the set, the obtained bonus score is calculated based on the number that the joker represents.
三友之加値三層。	A three-of-a-kind triples the bonus score.
歪片在於友連即裁加値而歪片一片在而手下一値。	Each joker in a set decreases the bonus score by one.
加値常上値。	The bonus score is always nonnegative.
如	Examples
全大此五。	5 is the largest.
五生二値即加値二値。	5 gives two points; the bonus score is two.
全大此歪。此時三	Joker is the largest. Here, it serves as a 3.
三生一値即三友三層此故三値。	3 gives one point. Since this is a three-of-a-kind, the bonus score is tripled, resulting in three points.
一片歪片在即加値二値。	Since there is a single joker, the bonus score is reduced to two points.
国官集来！	Lauzait-Cep!
或人開三位友連而手其友連之加値即其人言「国官集来！」而再受集来値。	After revealing the third set and earning the bonus score associated with the set, the player declares “Lauzait-Cep!” and receives the [⌛] score.
妙時開片無而三友連在手片之時同言「国官集来！」而再受集来値。	As an exception, if you have not revealed any pieces and have three valid combinations in your hand, you can declare "Lauzait-Cep!"" to gain the [⌛] score.
此時無能手開片加値。	In such a situation, you cannot earn the bonus score that would have been obtainable by revealing the sets.
集来値之全	The list of all [⌛] scores
国官集来	Lauzait-Cep (pronounced LOUD-site SEP)
軸道論集	Specialized Experts
全片同色	All the pieces have the same color
大連	Great Sequence
九連値	nine consecutive numbers 
層橋	Layered Bridges
於手片同値之二友連在	Two sets whose numbers exactly match
無須同色。友善連善。	Does not have to be the same color. It can either be a three-of-a-kind or a sequence-of-three.
筆兵無傾	Well-Balanced
筆之積値加兵之積値同	The sum of the numbers on the [⌛筆] pieces matches that of the Site Workers pieces
（歪片無目）	(Jokers are ignored)
闇戦之集	Stalemate
無能為。	When no action can be taken.
引人之時能斥之片此無在。反行上時而為心古行新即同為術無之時唯目此。	A situation in which there is no piece to discard during the hiring phase. It is considered a stalemate only if dissolving the department earlier was not an option to avoid this outcome.
闇戦之集此妙時。其時無目手片友連而言「国官集来！」	Stalemate is a special situation which, regardless of the combination of pieces in your hand, you declare “Lauzait-Cep!”
言「国官集来！」即裁値而季終。	When “Lauzait-Cep!” is declared, the scores are calculated and the Season ends.
其季無遊術全下即始「季之上裁」始季。	When the Season is not the final one, the setup for the next Season is performed and the new Season begins.
心古行新（全多一時）（無為此善）	Dissolving a Department (at most once) (optional)
妙時圧眉古時与労而手加値。	Sometimes, you regret what you have done in the past to obtain the score.
其時汝識心古行新之術。	In such cases, you can dissolve a department.
為此之時手其時開之友連再閉而反与開時手之加値。	To perform this action, you reconceal the set that you have previously revealed, and refund the bonus score that you have obtained at that time.
反与須正。	The refund must be done correctly.
無正如此。開「二三歪」手二値而下時汝心古行新「歪二三」反与一値。	An example of an incorrect refund is when you form a department as “2-3-Joker” and obtain two points but you dissolve it as “Joker-2-3” and refund one point.
悪享此使硬力須圧。	Benefit fraud must be heavily prosecuted.
遊術終時	End of the game
為終遊人多少之季亦全人満心之時遊終。	The game ends after the same number of rounds as there are players, or when all players are satisfied and decide to end the game.
其時全豊人上行。	The player with the highest score at that time wins.
全豊人多之時其之全人上行。	When there are multiple players with the highest score, they all win.
加律	Additional rules
学深即加行下律此同善噫。	Once you get used to the game, you can add the following rules.
上裁之下時開残片之一為此同光片。	After the setup, reveal one of the remaining unused pieces and designate it as the luminous piece.
光片於手片在之時言「国官集来！」即一片此一値。	Each luminous piece in your hand awards you an additional point when you declare “Lauzait-Cep!”
論	Q&A
圧字一位而我等銭軸享来此論。	We have received the following questions after the release of the first edition.
心善於与力。	We would like to thank you for your support.
開友連之時加於言「国官集来」之時裁歪片使別片乎？	Is it allowed to have the joker serve a different role when revealing a set compared to when declaring “Lauzait-Cep”?
闇集 adin之子如字	Baniwaim, son of Adin, from Pédé Province
善。	Yes.
於水行水之時須撃裁乎。	Do we need to throw the dice-sticks when the move starts & ends in water?
筆処集 皇光男	Tam Aikki, from Quahua Province
別於官定机戦汝須撃裁。	Unlike the standard rule of Cetkaik, you need to throw dice-sticks in such a situation.
為此律軟。	This is in order to simplify the rule.
使歪片於豊銭与労而於貧銭心古行新之件此善乎	Is it okay to use a joker to obtain some money and afterwards return less money by dissolving the department?
車馬集 筆座leledapa	Kasika Lélédapa, Kutia Province
即遊術行混混。	That would plunge the game into chaos.
於此位圧我等筆加行。	We have amended it in the current version.
